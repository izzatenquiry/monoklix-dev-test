# MONOklix.com - All-in-One AI Platform

## 🚀 User Flow

The application features a simplified, streamlined user flow:

1.  **External Registration & Payment:** New users register and pay on an external website (e.g., WooCommerce).
2.  **Automated Account Creation:** A webhook from the payment platform automatically creates a user account in the application's database with `lifetime` status.
3.  **Direct Email Login:** Users log in to the application using only their email address. No password is required.
4.  **Persistent Session:** The application uses `localStorage` to keep users logged in across browser sessions for a seamless experience.
5.  **Bring Your Own API Key (BYOK) - Primary Method:** To access the AI features, users must provide their own Google Gemini API Key on the **Settings** page. This is the recommended approach for unlimited access.
6.  **Temporary API Key Claim - Fallback:** If a user's key fails (e.g., due to invalidity or quota issues), or if they don't have one, the app will prompt them to claim a new, temporary API key. These keys have daily usage limits for regular users and are intended for immediate, short-term use.
